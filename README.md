# Multimonth View

## Description

## Description

Multimonth View is an open-source addon designed to enhance the Thunderbird calendar experience. It allows users to display multiple months in a single calendar view, making it easier to plan and visualize events over a longer period. This addon is particularly useful for students, enabling them to schedule their entire school or university year efficiently. It is compatible with Thunderbird 115 and is inspired by the [Year View addon](https://github.com/fabrixxm/Year-View), which is only compatible with older versions of Thunderbird and is not updated anymore.

## Features
